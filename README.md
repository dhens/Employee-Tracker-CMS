## This repo contains:
* This README
* A Node powered CLI app that allows a user to create various departments 
* A MySQL schema with three tables: departments, roles, and employees, and a seeds file that adds data rows to each table.

## Known Issues / Bugs
* N/A

## What I Learned:
* MySQL connection queries are reptitive and seem like they can be shortened potentially by writing a function to save time. For example, 'SELECT * FROM DESIRED-TABLE' could just be written into a function, rather than re-writing 3 times in my app.ks
* Researching best security practices for storing data is a monolith of requirements. It's hard to implement these currently as a green developer, but it's absolutely paramount to know before I enter a job as a developer.

## Conclusion:
* I struggled throughout the development of this app, despite pseudo-coding and following the best practices that I've learned up to this point. I started breaking down the barriers as I discussed my problems with other students and working on it together.
